This is a notes page to leave how I did this project and questions I came across and how I went about solving them.

Questions/Issues

1. I was having trouble trying to get the static methods to work. Some of the questions I googled were:
    -How to call static methods without dot notation?
    -How to call static methods without referencing class name?

Ultimately the second question helped me solve the issue.  I learned about static imports.  Also learned that static imports
should rarely be used because a lot of ambiguity could arise.  For example, you would like to know what class a method belongs to.

2. In thinking about the Inventory class, I realized that with an array you need to know ahead of time the size or amount 
of products you were going to have.  So basically I googled 
    -array that changes size
And that led me to Arraylists which can change dynamically.  I don't know if that is the right word.

3. I was thinking about to use the inventory class without creating an instance of Inventory.  First I created INventory then 
in the data field of the inventory class I created an arraylist.  Then in the Product class I created an Inventory object which 
is an arraylist.  I also ended up doing it another way.  In the Inventory class, I only used implement static methods. I didnt use
any data fields.  Then in product class I created a arraylist.  Then created a getter for the array list.  Then used the getter in
the inventory class.
